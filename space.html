                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                <br><br>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than
                the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                <br><br>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
                like spit in the ocean.
                <br><br>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
                and drew a double box around it.
                <br><br>
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
                Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
                universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
                of a second old. They are the long-sought
                smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
                that Dr. Guth was correct.
                <br><br>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether it could ever be
                proved.
                <br><br>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
                and space and energy to science and
                speculation.
                <br><br>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
                its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
                over.
                <br><br>
                <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
                <br>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
                would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle
                space-time.
                <br><br>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said,
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                <br><br>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                <br><br>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
                surface of the
                sun.
                <br><br>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical
                Journal.

                <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
                Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
                which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
                in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                        <b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old.
                        From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that
                        is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                        Wherever we look, the universe has an even
                        temperature.
                    </div>

                    <div class="p2">
                        <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to
                        carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold.
                        But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot,
                        all at the same time, that might explain their even
                        temperature.

                    <div class="p3">
                        <b>DISTANT COFFEE </b>At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look
                        a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam,
                        you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.

                    </div>

                        <b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE </b>Now turn around and look a mile in the other
                        direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
                        Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
                        you might want to look for another
                        explanation.

                    <div class="p5">

                        heir even temperature.

                        <b>INFLATION </b>solves this problem. The theory proposes that,
                        less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang,
                        the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.
                        Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into
                        the large-scale structures of the universe.

                        , which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational
                        waves predicted by Einstein.

                        like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
                        original pot.

                <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.

                </p>
                <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
                <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                    Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
                    few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is
                    his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
                <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who
                    chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
                <p>most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation
                    in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
                    <span link>knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</span> to tell him the news.

                <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
                <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think
                    that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
                    wrote in an email.</p>
                <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                    “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
                <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                    spread,
                    astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
                <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
                    down
                    as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                    called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
                    “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair
                    of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
                    but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that
                    the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
                    European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
                <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                    Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this
                    year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
                    measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

                <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
                    suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
                    comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other
                    bubbles endlessly
                    , a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
