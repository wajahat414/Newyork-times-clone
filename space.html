                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                <br><br>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than
                the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                <br><br>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
                like spit in the ocean.
                <br><br>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
                and drew a double box around it.
                <br><br>
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
                Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
                universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
                of a second old. They are the long-sought
                smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
                that Dr. Guth was correct.
                <br><br>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether it could ever be
                proved.
                <br><br>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
                and space and energy to science and
                speculation.
                <br><br>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
                its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
                over.
                <br>
                <h2 class="heading-style">‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
                would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle
                space-time.
                <br><br>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said,
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                <br><br>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                <br><br>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
                surface of the
                sun.
                <br><br>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical
                Journal.

                Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
                which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
                in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                        Wherever we look, the universe has an even

                        Dr.
                        Linde
                        wrote in an email.</p>
                    <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                        hyperventilating.
                        “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
                    <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
                        news
                        spread,
                        astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
                    <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
                        will go
                        down
                        as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                    <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                        project
                        called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
                        “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                    <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of
                        a
                        pair
                        of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate
                        his
                        model,
                        but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                    <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
                        noting
                        that
                        the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                        background by
                        the
                        European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
                    <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
                        findings
                        this
                        year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
                        measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

                        vision
                        suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
                        comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off
                        other
                        bubbles endlessly
                        , a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
